  In general, be careful with mushrooms that:<br>
  -Have a foul odor (strong correlation)<br>
  -Are located near paths (strong correlation)<br>
  -Have a buff-colored (light brownish yellow) gill (extreme correlation)<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Contrary to what you may think, the color of the cap is not a good predictor of whether the mushroom is poisonous<br>
  As you can see in the heat map below, the amount of edible and poisonous mushrooms are almost the same for every type
  of color<br>
  This means that it's a bad idea to assume a mushroom is safe to eat based on its color!<br>
  <br>
  In fact, all attributes concerning the cap, such as its shape and surface, are bad predictors for whether the mushroom
  is poisonous<br>
